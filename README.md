All files needed for exact hardware build. Works with Sequoia and Tahoe Public Beta. Includes USB map works in both Sequoia and Tahoe. Place all files in a new folder named EFI.
Audio works in Sequoia But in Tahoe you need USB Audio or HDMI Audio as Apple has dropped support for AppleALC. Added a config.plist with boot chime enabled.
